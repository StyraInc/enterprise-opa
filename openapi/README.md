## OpenAPI Spec

The OpenAPI spec included here represents a small surface area of 
the Enterprise OPA and Open Policy Agent API –– only the APIs for executing policy requests.

This OpenAPI spec was crafted by hand, not auto-generated.

It is used by the Speakeasy service to generate SDKs in Java, C#, Typescript, and Python.
As such, it includes some custom annotations & extensions.
